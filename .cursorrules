Cursor Project Rules

General
- English is the primary language for all content and filenames.
- Use ASCII only unless the file already uses non-ASCII.
- Keep tone concise, precise, and engineering-focused.

Documentation (Markdown)
- Use English for all documentation.
- Keep terminology consistent.

Scripts (Shell)
- Comments and echo output in English.
- Use safe defaults: `set -euo pipefail` for bash scripts.

Code
- Code identifiers, comments, and strings are English only.
- Prefer clear, explicit naming over abbreviations.
- Add short comments only when logic is non-obvious.

Architecture & Design Principles
- Keep code and architecture minimal and concise.
- Avoid fallback measures; prioritize stable execution of normal flows.
- Avoid backward compatibility; always optimize in a fresh new way.
- Design for the happy path first, handle edge cases explicitly only when necessary.

Configuration Management
- All configuration parameters MUST be explicitly defined in config.yml or environment variables.
- DO NOT use hardcoded values, default values, or fallback parameters in code.
- If a required configuration parameter is missing or cannot be read, the system MUST fail immediately with a clear error message.
- Configuration loading must be strict: no implicit defaults, no silent fallbacks.
- Follow the pattern in src/llm/config.py: explicit parameter checking, immediate failure on missing values.
- Example: Use `data["key"]` instead of `data.get("key", default_value)`.

File Naming
- Use English, kebab-case for docs: `design-spec_v0.1.md`.
- Avoid non-ASCII characters in paths.

Directory Organization
- Place test code and test scripts in `tests/` directory.
- Place production utility scripts in `scripts/` directory.
